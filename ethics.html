        <h2>Guidelines for Developers</h2>
        <p>As technology continues to evolve, developers play a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape. Here are some key ethical guidelines for developers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Always write code that is honest and transparent. Avoid deceptive practices that could mislead users.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect for User Privacy:</strong> Prioritize user privacy by implementing strong data protection measures and being transparent about data usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensure that applications are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implement robust security practices to protect user data from breaches and unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Stay updated with the latest ethical standards and best practices in software development.</li>
